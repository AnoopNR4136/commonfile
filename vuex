Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. 
It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, 
with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. 

1) state

state:{
use{
id:1,
name:'Ann'}

}

//simply geting state values
$store.state.user.name







actions:{
login({commit},user){

    }
}
//Calling
this.$store
        .dispatch("login", {
          user_email: this.email,
          user_password: this.password,
        })
        ////////
//mutation

  mutations: {
   
     auth_success(state, token){
    state.status = 'success'
       state.token = token
      
  
    },
//caling

commit('auth_success', token)
